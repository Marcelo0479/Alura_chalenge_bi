The challenge consists of creating three Power BI reports in order to show the necessary skills to do so. Its has been divided by difficulty levels in the following order:

 - [Logistic challenge](https://www.alura.com.br/challenges/bi/semana-01-logistica)
 - [Marketing challenge](https://www.alura.com.br/challenges/bi/semana-02-marketing)
 - Financial challenge

## First challenge:
To deal with the pandemic situation, Aluralog's manager needs to know how the deliveries services demand is. He needs to know the number of deliveries, how many were made on time and late, and the number of vehicles avaliable. Furthermore, he wants to know the S2D (ship to door) in days, the occurrence index by states and the average level of stock by year.

To make this first report, I divided into three pages, front page, delivery dashboard and sales dashboard.
In the delivery dashboard, I puted the number of deliveries, the information of on-time and late deliveries, the S2D indicator, the amount of vehicles available and the average level of stock by year.
In the sales dashboard, I placed the occurrence rate map by states and improved the report by adding the total products, the total revenue and two charts with sales breakdown per month and by product type.

Another improvement I made was putting navigation icons on the report. On the front page, two icons, each for a dashboard, and on each dashboard a right arrow to the next dashboard and a left arrow to go back to the front page.

## Second challenge:
AluraShop invested in advertising to stand out in marketing and the company manager has doubts if the return of this advertising took effect. My mission is to support managers in their decision making and clarify their doubts. For this, I will develop a strategic market dashboard in order to monitor the advertising campaign during the month of July 2021. Furthermore I will show relevant indicators for the validation of the business strategy.
